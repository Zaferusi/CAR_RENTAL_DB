I will explain you how to create a relational database for a car rental company database step by step.

1-Once project aim is determined, the requirements analysis is carried out.This
is done by investigating all reuired objects at first.
For example, we just do a brainstorming to reach which objects will be neccesary to useful for this Db.
As they are examples related to car rental job, such as Car, Bill, Booking, Customers.

2- At second step we must describe these objects, so we assign them their attributes.
Attributes are terms describing entities. For example customer name, customer email will be attributes of customer entity.

3-Now we are developing neccesary entities by extras. So we need them to describe better integrated and protected.
So our extra entities are Car_Type, and also ISO relation tables including available and rental car.
We need these to save memory and protected them by seperating each other.

4-Now, we have to establish the relations between these entities. As you know there are more than one relation type, as one to one one to many and many to many.
As an example car_tpe foreign key just is a one tto one relation though customer_id attribute existing in bookings table is a one to many relation because of one customer can do more than one bookings.

5-So in physical design we have to care assigning columns true in terms of these relations.
